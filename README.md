# Pyxis — architecture & design

Public notes on the architecture of [Pyxis](https://pyxis3.com), a model-agnostic LLM serving infrastructure. This is the **why** repo — design decisions, the model-agnosticity argument, and the operating model.

## The thesis

Enterprises running language models in production today face a triple lock-in problem:

1. **Cloud lock-in** — the inference fleet lives on one cloud's GPUs (AWS, GCP, Azure); moving a model means re-implementing the serving stack
2. **Vendor lock-in** — the control plane is bound to one MLOps vendor (Seldon, ClearML, ZenML, Domino); moving means losing audit, lineage, fair-share scheduling
3. **Runtime lock-in** — the model is wired to one inference runtime (vLLM, TGI, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang); moving means re-tuning latency/throughput from scratch

Each lock-in is independent. Each has a different cost to break. None of the existing platforms solve all three.

**Pyxis is the operations layer that lets you mix and match.** The same control plane drives the same models on the same KPIs across heterogeneous fleets — cloud, on-prem, mixed.

## Surfaces

- **Control plane** — Kubernetes-native; operator + CRDs for model serving, batch inference, evaluation jobs
- **Tenancy** — fair-share scheduling at the GPU level; per-team quotas; cost attribution
- **Runtime adapters** — uniform interface to vLLM, TGI, Triton, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, Ollama; route by model size, latency budget, hardware availability
- **Audit & lineage** — every inference call tagged with model version, runtime version, hardware class, requesting tenant
- **Observability** — Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces; pluggable into existing observability stacks

## Design decisions

### Why Kubernetes-native

Every serious AI infrastructure in 2026 ships on Kubernetes. Building a non-K8s control plane means building cluster orchestration we'd inherit for free. Operator + CRDs is the convention; we follow it.

### Why heterogeneous-fleet-first

Most "AI platforms" assume homogeneous fleets — one cloud, one GPU class, one runtime. Real enterprises run mixed estates. Pyxis assumes mixed by default and treats homogeneous as a degenerate case.

### Why no managed inference

Pyxis is the control plane, not the runtime. We integrate with the runtimes that already exist — we don't compete with vLLM. The vLLM author's team is doing inference better than we ever will; our job is to make their work fit into a tenanted, observable, audited operations envelope.

### Why model-agnostic matters

If Pyxis added a managed inference offering, every cloud + every model vendor would push back on integration. By staying neutral, Pyxis becomes the layer everyone integrates with rather than the layer everyone competes against.
